Welcome to my new home!

I used to run a small blog over at https://maxshields.wordpress.com/ but had suspended my work there when I bought an early subscription to The Grid. It took a longer than I expected, but here we are, and this is my first post on this innovative and exciting new medium.
![There's beauty in the smallest of things](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/44bb1af4-596b-492b-9d67-69c785b916e9.jpg)

Before I get too carried away, a little about me: I am an artist, a photographer, a writer, and an indie game developer. Most of my time these days is being invested in a wonderful project called Astrobase Command.  I am part of a small team of superb individuals pouring our hearts into making an awesome retro sci-fi 3D space station simulator. Why don't you take a moment to swing by and check it out (http://www.astrobasecommand.com)?
