**PHOTOGRAPHY**

I have always enjoyed taking pictures. As a child, I must have cost my parents a fortune in film as I romped through the woods looking for interesting photos of, well, just about anything. I also fiddled with my parent's ancient film SLR camera, but didn't have much of an idea of what I was doing.

I truly discovered photography in 2004 or 2005 as I moved up to my first DSLR. It was quite a moment, and I brought it along as I traveled the world.

I enjoy taking photos of landscapes and have recently turned my lens towards macro photography. I'm keen to learn about artistic portraits, though I have not had the opportunity to take many as of yet.

I look forward to sharing more photos with you!
