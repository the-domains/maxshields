## Illustration

I have always loved drawing. It kept me focused as I slogged my way through school, yielding unexpectedly high academic results (see: I WAS paying attention!) and has continued to develop over the years through my countless doodles and scratches.

Along the way, I fell in love with graphics tablets and photoshop. Although I still have much to learn, I've had the opportunity with my work over at Jellyfish Games to explore illustration, vector art, and graphic design. I've designed numerous icons and have worked on promotional imagery. Over the course of two or more years with the team, I've happily seen my skills and confidence grow. 

It is indeed one of the great joys of working on an indie game development project: because there aren't enough people and skills to go around, we all need to become multidisciplinary and get involved where we would not otherwise have.
